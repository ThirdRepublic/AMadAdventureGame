# A Mad Adventure Game

This project first began in Software Engineering (CS-4513) and continued into Senior Design (CS-4523).  During Software Engineering, the documentation and strucutre for the project was designed and defined.  For Senior Design, the implementation of the project is developed.  

## Proposed Project
We propose a mobile game that not only entertains players but also raises their critical thinking skills and challenges them.  Nonetheless, similar to most adventure games, we want to help people temporarily escape reality and delve into another world where they can unwind themselves and enjoy small moments. 

One thing that sets The Mad Adventure Game apart from other adventure games is that it will have edificial elements.  While each adventure will vary by location, whether it contains history, science/technology, literature, etc, the structure of the game itself remain the same.  The player is allowed to select a theme that is based on a location and select the difficulty level.  The Mad Adventure Game will be a single-player RPG that allows users to easily pick up where they have left off.  Each gameplay will consist of a map where the player has to traverse the maze, avoid enemies, obtain items and escape the maze.
